<h3>Day 1:</h3>
<p><img alt="photo" height="300px" src="/images/mahendra1.jpg" width="450px" /></p>
<p>This is my first session with little huge participants. In this sessions I have covered up HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I was made them to design a simple attractive static web page using bootstrap. The page consist of <em>Heading, Image representation, col-md, table, etc</em>.</p>
<p>In bootstrap, Classes like <em>container, container-fluid, text-center, col-md, jumbotron, table primitives etc</em> were used to buid a simple web page. Most of the audience were successfully built an web page and felt happy with bootstrap. Due to insufficient time, I couldn't cover more topics in bootstrap.</p>
<h3>Day 2:</h3>
<p>Day to I was took Python and Flask session. In python, I covered up with basics of python such as <em>printing, arithmetic operations, type casting, list, tuple, dictionary, etc</em>. Participants were attendively come up with outputs for the task which I have given to them. </p>
<p>In afternoon session, I have gone to <em>Flask</em>. Flask is a micro web framework in python. Before entering into flask, I have explained them networking and how routing taking place. After that, I have explained what is request and what is response, also GET and POST method in HTTP. At last I have entered into Flask. Participants was very eager to make their first tiny web app. I have ended the session with form handling in Flask.</p>
